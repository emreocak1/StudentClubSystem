This project was developed as our graduation project at Eastern Mediterranean University. Our objective is to introduce a centralized digital platform for managing all student club activities. We observed inefficiencies in current systems that rely heavily on paperwork and manual processes. Our solution addresses these pain points with a web-based application, ensuring faster, smarter, and more accessible club operations for students and staff alike.

Currently, student clubs are an essential part of campus life, promoting social engagement and skill-building. However, the administrative side of these clubs is often neglected, managed through physical documents, emails, and inconsistent tracking. This creates confusion in approvals, club elections, announcements, and membership records. Our system introduces a centralized, digital environment that offers complete visibility and control to all stakeholders. By eliminating the dependency on paperwork and disconnected tools, we are offering a transparent, user-friendly experience that empowers both students and administrative staff.
The scope of this system covers three main user roles: administrators, club presidents, and students. Each role has defined permissions. Admins manage all backend data and club verifications. Presidents manage their specific club events, members, and elections. Students can join clubs, vote, and view announcements.
The university lacks a consistent digital infrastructure for club management. Processes like application review, elections, and event tracking are often handled via emails, printed papers, or in-person meetings. These methods lead to data loss, approval delays, and reduced student engagement. Additionally, election processes are non-transparent and difficult to audit. Our interviews with club presidents and student affairs staff confirmed the need for an integrated solution.

We set clear goals for our system from the start:
•	To digitalize the club member registration and simplify approval workflows.
•	To provide role-specific panels for admins, club presidents, and regular members.
•	To automate club elections via an electronic voting system.
•	To provide notification and announcement features for enhanced communication.
•	To ensure that all actions are traceable, secure, and user-friendly.
Each feature is designed to solve a specific problem observed in the traditional club management approach.

Our system provides the following tangible and intangible benefits:
•	Automated forms and registration eliminate repetitive manual approvals.
•	Digital voting increases transparency and engagement in club elections.
•	The unified platform strengthens student interaction with club activities.
•	Admin dashboards provide real-time statistics and control.
•	The user-friendly design encourages adoption even among non-technical users.
•	Overall, the system boosts operational speed, reliability, and communication.
